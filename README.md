## Project Description

Interaction Design Project developed combining [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) for the course of Computer Music Languages and Systems.

<em>BOUNCER</em> is a system that produces music following the movements of a basketball player, and can provide a pleasant background for a training session. Exploiting the combination of hardware and software interactions the user can manipulate both the music generated by the system and the visuals connected to it.
A complete description of the development of the system can be found in the [report](https://github.com/Pox17/group5-HW-Juce-PLAS/blob/main/report2.pdf).

## Getting Started


In order to start the system on your own Computer:



1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
2. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/).
3. Download and install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
4. Clone the repo.
5. Open the file basketball.pde inside the folder *Processing* 
6. Make sure to have the following libraries installed (in Sketch > Import Libraries > Manage Libraries):
   -  ControlP5 
   -  Sound
   -  OSCP5
   -  Supercollider
7. Open the file basketball.scd inside the folder *SuperCollider*
8. In the .scd file run (cmd+enter) the first four section 
9.  ENJOY!! 



## Usage


1. The <em>GUI</em> is divided in two channelstrips, one for each channel. Each channel-strip contains some controls:

   * The ON-Button allows to turn ON or turn OFF the single channel
   * ![image info](./gitAssets/CHANNELON.PNG)
   

   * The Filter-ON button allows to turn ON or OFF the single input-filter.
   
   * The Filter-switch allows to select type of input-filter between Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass.
   
   * The Frequency-Dial allows to change the the cut-off or central frequency of the filter. 
   
   * The Q-Dial allows to change the the cut-off or central frequency of the filter. 
   * ![image info](./gitAssets/FILTER.PNG)
   


   * The gain Dial allows to enhance the input gain in order to make the distortion stronger.

   * The Tone Dial allows to control the tone filter applied after distortion.

   * The Volume Dial allows to control the volume applied at the end of the channel processing.

   * The WET knob allows to blend wet and dry signal to

2. The master section allows to control the parameters that involve the processing in the whole plugin:

   * The **LR** and **MS** buttons allows to change the two channels encoding between Left-Right and Mid-Side processing.  

   * Two double level meters allow to monitor the input and output PEAK-Levels.
  
   * The destroy button allows the user to add a distortion block that enhances harmonic content transforming the first gain dial in a linear input gain.

   * The **Destruction Dial** controls a characteristic parameter for the Destruction function that allows to modify the dynamic function in order to enhance the harmonic content.

## Distortion Curves

<br>
On the video below we can see the non-linear response function associated with the standard distortion of the plugin.

## Distorted Signals

<br>
Here you can appreciate how a sinusoidal input is affected by the normal distortion function while the gain goes from minimum to maximum value.

## Folder Structure

The project repository contains one Projucer file that contains the main project setup with builds for:
* VISUAL STUDIO 22 
* VISUAL STUDIO 19
* XCODE
The projucer file stores two folders:
* "Source" containing the Source code for building the plugin.
* "Assets" containing the images used for the GUI.
* "pointers" contains the images used as pointers for the panner window.
* "gitAssets" contains all the images used in the report and in the README.


## Notes

* The system has been built and tested on Windows 10 OS machines built using VISUAL STUDIO 22 and on MAC OS using XCODE.
* The plugin has been tested on REAPER and Ableton Live both on Windows and MAC and on Garage Band.
