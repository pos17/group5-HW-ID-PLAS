## Project Description

Interaction Design Project developed combining [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) for the course of Computer Music Languages and Systems.

<em>BOUNCER</em> is a system that produces music following the movements of a basketball player, and can provide a pleasant background for a training session. Exploiting the combination of hardware and software interactions the user can manipulate both the music generated by the system and the visuals connected to it.
A complete description of the development of the system can be found in the [report]().

## Getting Started


In order to start the system on your own Computer:



1. Download and install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
2. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/).
3. Download and install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
4. Clone the repo.
5. Open the file basketball.pde inside the folder *Processing* 
6. Make sure to have the following libraries installed (in Sketch > Import Libraries > Manage Libraries):
   -  ControlP5 
   -  Sound
   -  OSCP5
   -  Supercollider
7. Run the file clicking on the *PLAY BUTTON*, (MACOS: cmd+R, Windows: ctrl+R)
8. Open the file basketball.scd inside the folder *SuperCollider*
9.  In the .scd file run the main code section (MACOS: cmd+enter, Windows: ctrl+enter) 
10. Install the [Multisense OSC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.polytechnique.multisense.release&hl=en_US&gl=US) application on a smartphone device. 
11. ENJOY!! 



## Usage

1. Start the Multisense App on the Smartphone. 
2. Position the shake sensor connected to the arduino on the dominant hand used by the player and Turn the Arduino on.  
3. 

## Folder Structure

The project repository contains one Projucer file that contains the main project setup with builds for:
* VISUAL STUDIO 22 
* VISUAL STUDIO 19
* XCODE
The projucer file stores two folders:
* "Source" containing the Source code for building the plugin.
* "Assets" containing the images used for the GUI.
* "pointers" contains the images used as pointers for the panner window.
* "gitAssets" contains all the images used in the report and in the README.
